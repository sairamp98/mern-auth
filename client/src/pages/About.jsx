          This project represents a significant milestone in my journey as a full-stack developer. Leveraging the MERN stack, I developed a robust authentication system that incorporates modern security practices. One of the key technologies I implemented was JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication. By using JWT, I was able to create a secure and stateless authentication mechanism, ensuring that user sessions remain protected and scalable. This project not only solidified my understanding of the MERN stack but also deepened my knowledge of secure authentication methods and best practices in web development.
